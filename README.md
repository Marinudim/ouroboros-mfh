Install
----------------
```
npm install ouroboros-mfh
```

Usage
----------------
```js
const ouroborosMFH = require('ouroboros-mfh')

// run ouroboros
ouroborosMFH({ 
    server: server_name, // server_name = express()
    myDomain: '[www].domain', // your site name to be keeper
    // some active domain when you have no ouroboros chain
    defaultDomain: 'www.fastchooser.com'
})    

// set chain-collection in mongodb into global variable
global.ouroborosMFH = database.collection('ouroborosMFH')

/* To join the system as a keeper, you need to have an HTTPS  
website with a maximum of 3 levels for your domain name with  
only “www” on the third level that will be used as a node  
in the system. It is also required to use NodeJS and MongoDB  
for now.  

Create a new exhibit on letterevo.com. Then contact  
by email letterevo@gmail.com notifying it that you want  
to be a keeper and send your site’s name and the number  
of your exhibit. After checking your site, ten thousand mannas  
will be transferred to your exhibit. Then transfer at least  
one cell (0.000001 Manna) anywhere from the first exhibit.  

While making the transaction, in the field “message” write  
your domain name in the following format:  
<add>sitename.com  

If post requests on your site are available with "www",  
don’t count on redirecting, write it with "www":  
<add>www.sitename.com
*/
```
